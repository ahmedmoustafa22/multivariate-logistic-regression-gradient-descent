# Gradient Descent for Multivariate Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project implements logistic regression to classify whether a house in California is above or below the median house value based on features such as location, number of rooms, and population.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **California Housing Prices** dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about housing in California, including median house value, location, and other features.

## Code
The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:
- `numpy` for numerical computations.
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `scikit-learn` for preprocessing and polynomial features.
- `kagglehub` to download the dataset.
