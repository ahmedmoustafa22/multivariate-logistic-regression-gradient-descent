# Gradient Descent for Multivariate Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project implements gradient descent for multivariate logistic regression using polynomial regression (degree `d`) on the California Housing Dataset. The goal is to predict housing prices by optimizing logistic regression with polynomial feature transformation.

## Dataset
The California Housing Dataset is used, which contains features such as median income, housing median age, and location coordinates.

## Features
- Polynomial feature transformation (degree `d`).
- Gradient descent optimization for logistic regression.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multivariate-logistic-regression-gradient-descent.git
